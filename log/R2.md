The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on February 23, Tuesday, 2021.

<!--  Example
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 0: February 23, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Today I was working with an old product called [Product Manager Redux](https://github.com/angelmtztrc/product-manager-redux), I update the way that I used to integrate Tailwind CSS and also I added redux-toolkit instead of using vanilla redux. I learned a little more about redux, and tomorrow I'll start with the testing in the application.

### Day 1: February 24, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Today I was working with the "Product Manager Redux" adding some testing, although I stopped to investigate more about testing with redux. And I also changed a little bit of the design of my website, which I hope to release in a few days.

### Day 2: February 26, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Today I was working on a new project, a Pets Store built with NextJS. I still working on the design.

**Thoughts:** I still haven't decided what technology to use for the Back-end. Maybe I gonna use Strapi or Vendure.
