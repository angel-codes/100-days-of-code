##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I builded a little Weather App with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS

**Thoughts**: I'm very happy to finish my first project after the challenge and I still love all the things I can do with Tailwind CSS. I'm not good at thinking nice designs but with Tailwind CSS I can do things that look decently good.
